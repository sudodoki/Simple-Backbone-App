Simple Backbone app backed using [Backbone.localStorage](https://github.com/jeromegn/Backbone.localStorage) by [@jeromegn](https://github.com/jeromegn)
Compiled using coffee script and its magic command, namely
`coffee --join app.js -cwb coffee/app.coffee coffee/routers coffee/models/ coffee/collections/ ffee/views/`
Not very fancy, but will have it's place at venue of my own shitty boilerplates.
